# Computer Architecture

* **A computer consists of multiple hardware components that work together to execute programs.**

💡 **Think of a CPU like a chef in a restaurant:**
- **Ingredients (Data)** – The numbers it processes.
- **Recipe (Program)** – A set of instructions.
- **Chef (CPU)** – The processor that follows the instructions.
- **Kitchen Helpers (Registers)** – Store frequently used values.
- **Kitchen Counters (RAM)** – Holds temporary data.

## 🔄 Instruction Cycle (Fetch-Decode-Execute)

1️ **Fetch:** Get the next instruction from memory.  
2️ **Decode:** Determine what the instruction does.  
3️ **Execute:** Perform the operation.

💡 **Analogy:** Like following a cooking recipe – fetch a step, understand it, and execute it.

## 🖥️ CPU Components

| Component | Role (Analogy) |
|-----------|---------------|
| **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** | The **knife** that processes numbers |
| **Registers** | **Small bowls** for frequently used ingredients |
| **Control Unit** | **Head Chef**, managing execution |
| **Program Counter (PC)** | **Bookmark** for the next instruction |
| **Stack** | **Pile of plates**, follows Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) |

## 📝 Practice Questions
1. Explain the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle in simple terms.
2. Why are registers faster than RAM?
3. What happens if the Program Counter (PC) is incorrect?
4. Draw a simple diagram of a CPU’s architecture and label the components.

✅ **Challenge:** Imagine you're designing a new processor. What special feature would you add to make it more efficient?
